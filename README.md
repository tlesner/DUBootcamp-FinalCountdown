# DU-Bootcamp-Final Caountdown

## It's the Final Countdown

Our team wanted to build a project that was meaningful and usable in the rest of the bootcamp. This project allows the user to set timers when studying, taking a break, or otherwise in need of tracking time.

**Tech used:**

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Bootstrap.

## Lessons Learned

The team learned valuable lessons in working in a cooperative environment with conflicting approval requests and differing ideas. We learned the importance of letting all ideas come to the table and discussing the importance of these ideas for the project. The team learned how to pull, push and merge requests.
